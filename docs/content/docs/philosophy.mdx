description: Core principles and design philosophy behind SOFIA
---

SOFIA is built on three fundamental principles that guide its design and implementation:

## 1. Simplicity First

We believe that powerful tools don't need to be complex. SOFIA emphasizes:

### Clear Abstractions
- Steps represent distinct conversation states
- Tools are just Python functions
- Routes are explicit transition rules

### Minimal Boilerplate
- Quick setup with sensible defaults
- Declarative configuration options
- Straightforward API design

### Intuitive Concepts
- Conversations flow through steps
- Tools provide capabilities
- Personas define behavior

## 2. Flexibility By Design

Different projects have different needs. SOFIA adapts to yours:

### Multiple Configuration Styles
- Use Python for programmatic control
- Use YAML for declarative setup
- Mix both approaches as needed

### Extensible Architecture
- Create custom tools
- Implement your own LLM providers
- Define specialized step types

### Framework Agnostic
- Works with any Python framework
- Integrates with existing systems
- No forced dependencies

## 3. Structured Approach

Organization and predictability are key to building reliable agents:

### Step-Based Design
- Clear conversation flow
- Controlled tool access
- Explicit state transitions

### Context Management
- Maintain conversation state
- Track tool usage
- Handle session persistence

### Predictable Behavior
- Consistent persona responses
- Well-defined error handling
- Reliable state transitions

## Design Decisions

### Why Steps?
Steps provide:
- Clear organization of complex flows
- Controlled access to tools
- Explicit state management
- Easy debugging and monitoring

### Why Tools as Functions?
Function-based tools offer:
- Simple implementation
- Clear interfaces
- Easy testing
- Natural integration

### Why Personas?
Personas ensure:
- Consistent agent behavior
- Brand alignment
- Context-aware responses
- Natural interactions

## Best Practices

SOFIA encourages:

1. **Keep Steps Focused**
   - One main responsibility per step
   - Clear transition conditions
   - Limited tool access

2. **Design Tools Carefully**
   - Pure functions when possible
   - Clear input/output contracts
   - Proper error handling

3. **Use Explicit Routing**
   - Clear transition conditions
   - Well-defined flow paths
   - Proper error states

4. **Maintain Context**
   - Track important state
   - Pass relevant information
   - Handle persistence
