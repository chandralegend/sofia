title: SOFIA Builder UI
description: Visual interface for designing and testing SOFIA agents
---

The SOFIA Builder is a visual development environment for creating and managing SOFIA agents. It provides a drag-and-drop interface for designing agent flows, testing tools, and generating configurations.

## Getting Started

### Installation

The Builder UI is included in the SOFIA CLI package:

```bash
pip install sofia-agent[cli]
```

### Launching the Builder

Start the Builder interface using the CLI:

```bash
sofia builder
```

This will launch the web interface at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Interface Overview

### Main Components

The Builder interface consists of:

1. **Canvas**: The main workspace where you design your agent flow
2. **Toolbox**: Contains available nodes and connections
3. **Property Panel**: Configure selected elements
4. **Preview Panel**: Test your agent in real-time

## Building Flows

### Adding Steps

1. Drag a "Step" node from the toolbox onto the canvas
2. Configure the step properties:
   - Step ID
   - Description
   - Available tools
   - Routing conditions

### Connecting Steps

1. Click the output port of a step
2. Drag to connect to another step's input port
3. Configure the route condition in the Property Panel

### Tool Configuration

1. Select "Tools" in the Property Panel
2. Add tool references or implementations
3. Configure tool parameters and validation

## Testing and Debugging

### Live Preview

Test your agent in real-time:
1. Click "Start Session" in the Preview Panel
2. Enter test inputs
3. See step transitions and tool executions

### Flow Validation

The Builder automatically validates:
- Step connections
- Tool availability
- Route conditions
- Configuration completeness

### Debug Tools

- **Step Inspector**: View step execution details
- **Tool Logger**: Monitor tool calls and responses
- **State Viewer**: Examine session state

## Exporting

### Configuration Export

Export your flow as:
- YAML configuration
- Python code
- Flow diagram

### Deployment Package

Generate a complete project:
1. Click "Export Project"
2. Choose export options:
   - Include tools
   - Add requirements
   - Generate tests

## Advanced Features

### Custom Nodes

Create custom node types:
1. Define node template
2. Implement behavior
3. Add to toolbox

### Flow Templates

Save and load flow templates:
- Common patterns
- Best practices
- Starting points

### Integration

The Builder supports:
- Version control integration
- Team collaboration
- Custom tool repositories

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| New Step | Ctrl/Cmd + N |
| Connect Steps | Alt + Drag |
| Delete Selected | Delete |
| Undo | Ctrl/Cmd + Z |
| Redo | Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Z |
| Save | Ctrl/Cmd + S |
| Export | Ctrl/Cmd + E |

## Best Practices

### Flow Design

- Keep flows modular
- Use clear step names
- Document conditions
- Test edge cases

### Performance

- Group related steps
- Optimize tool usage
- Cache common operations

### Collaboration

- Use consistent naming
- Document changes
- Share templates
- Version control
